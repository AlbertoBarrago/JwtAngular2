# Angular 2: Authentication sample.

This sample shows how to create an angular 2 app that:
* Has **lots of different routes**
* Performs **authentication with JWTs**
* **Calls APIs** authenticated and not.
* Extends the **RouterOutlet** for route pipeline changes.

## Running it

First, run the server app in the port `3001`.

- Then, run `npm install` on this project and run `npm start` to start the app. 
- Then just navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) :boom:
Use `npm run server` to run API server.
